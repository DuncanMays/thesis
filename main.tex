\section{Overview and Motivation}

With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), it is expected that by 2027, 41 billion IoT devices will come online, generating an additional 800 zettabytes of data. The time-sensitive nature of this data is expected to force 90\% of analytics to be performed at the edge to avoid latency of transmission to remote data centers as would be done in cloud computing. Thus, Multi-access Edge Computing MEC has emerged as a computing paradigm that can enable data processing at the edge (i.e., edge processing).

MEC consists of the utilization of dedicated edge infrastructure pieces built and owned by service providers to facilitate this data processing. This has the advantage of bringing compute resources close to the data which it must operate on, but the disadvantage of relying on companies and service providers for basic computing services that would normally be provided by hardware within the devices owned by consumers. Reliance on such an oligopoly can be avoided by tapping into the profuse compute resources in edge devices themselves such as smartphones, PCs, autonomous vehicles and other consumer-owned computers. Instead of depending on infrastructure that is owned by profit-motivated companies, consumer devices can share compute resources to accommodate each othersâ€™ needs. This is Extreme Edge Computing (EEC), and differs from MEC in that the compute nodes have heterogeneous and uncertain characteristics.

Edge devices come in many forms, from the powerful Machine Learning (ML) acceleration hardware found in autonomous vehicles to the smallest IoT device operating on battery power. This heterogeneity in compute resources is a major issue for EEC, and forces orchestrators that wish to harness the distributed compute in these devices to have some way to assess their capabilities. Moreover, these edge devices are owned by consumers, who may try to use their devices for tasks other than what the EEC system has delegated to them. This causes the compute characteristics of these devices to be uncertain, as they can change over time when faced with load from other tasks. Moreover, consumer privacy is a paramount concern. Some consumers may not wish to share identifying characteristics of their devices with an orchestrator, and so scheduling decisions have to be made in a decentralized manner to preserve private information.

ML has found itself at the core of many technologies used by edge devices today. Object detection, speech recognition and text completion are all applications that depend on neural networks trained on huge corpusses of data. The data-intensive nature of training neural networks has motivated this training to be done at the edge, and thus Mobile Edge Learning (MEL) has been developed as a way for resource-constrained edge devices to collaboratively train a single model. Despite being resource-constrained individually, the collective power of such devices can be significantly profuse. The integration of these abundant yet underutilized computational resources with MEL provides a promising edge learning paradigm for a broad range of IoT and edge computing applications.

\section{Challenges}
Implementing algorithms in an MEL environment presents several problems which the developer must overcome. We now provide three of these issues associated with MEL, which are device heterogeneity, uncertainty in device capabilities and consumer privacy.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Device Heterogeneity:} EEC entails the usage of consumer devices on the edge of the internet, tablets, smart devices, laptops. Such devices have varying compute and computation capabilities, as they possess different hardware, power needs and network connection quality. Heterogeneity of learner devices poses a resource allocation issue, as learners must be assigned a task no longer than the time given to solve it. Should all learners be assigned the same task, the cluster would be limited by its weakest learner, which is an unacceptable compromise.
      
  \item \textbf{Uncertainty in Device Capabilities:} In a real MEL system, learner devices are owned by consumers and companies that may use them for other tasks throughout the training regime. This will interfere with the training capabilities of affected learners through resource contention, and therefor poses another resource allocation issue. Variability in device capabilities, possibly due to contention with other tasks, can be modeled as uncertainty.
  
  \item \textbf{Consumer Privacy:} Many consumers value their privacy, and so to improve the adoption of their product, companies must use algorithms that minimize the amount of data being sent over the network for analysis. In some cases, data exchanges are limited by laws such as the European Commission's General Data Privacy Regulation, which places stringent limits on data collection. Such concerns can extend to data on the compute capabilities of learner devices, as this information could be used to monitor user behavior or even identify devices.
